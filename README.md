# Snowball's Moods

Snowball's Moods is my first ever web app that I built as an introduction to coding and web development. I started this project in December of 2018 and since then, the many updates I've added have taught me about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, and much more. You can visit the live application [here.](https://lindaazhao.github.io/snowballs-moods/)

How Does it Work?
-----------------
The main idea of this project was to create a dynamic frontend for fun weather reports that are displayed to the user via a character named Snowball. To do this, I used [ipapi](https://ipapi.co/) to retrieve the user's current location and another API called [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to fetch the current weather. Then, using the weather condition codes provided by OpenWeatherMap, I assigned each weather condition to one of Snowball's moods to display. 


The conditions that Snowball follow are:
* Snowball charges at nighttime (between the hours of sunset and sunrise on the following day) - robots need rest too!!
* If it is less than 30 minutes after sunrise, Snowball is woke.
* In not-so-nice conditions, Snowball is dazed.
* In sunny weather, Snowball is happy.
* Cloudy = shy.
* Snowy weather = winking. ;)

And that about sums everything up! Thanks for checking out this project :)
